      "WOW what can I say? if your reading this even considering booking to go here? DO IT - The Dry Island is located in the most beautiful part of the whole of the UK, me and my Girlfriend drove up from the Midlands England we had a choice of going the faster route (via A9) or the more scenic drive via the A82 we went with the scenic route and im so glad we did as it meant we saw some amazing scenery and stopped a lot on the way up and that was before we even arrived at Dry Island and Otter Cabin, When we did arrive i was blown away by how amazing the island was in a beautiful little bay the bridge across to it i dont think i could ever get tired of walking across! Otter Cabin itself was perfect in a lovely secudled part of the island with beautiful views both from the decking and the Hot Tub! The hosts were great and very helpful with given us advice on where to go and what was open etc... Honestly the only thing I would say is I wish I booked longer! again if you are even considering booking this! Do It! We will certainly be going back",

      "Great wee place if you are looking to get away from it all. We were lucky enough to see a few seals playing in the water and a wee otter spending his morning catching his breakfast and coming on to the rocks to eat. If you are into wildlife then this is the perfect place. Our wee dogs had a great time too üòä",
